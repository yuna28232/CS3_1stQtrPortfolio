# Reflection!

## List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.

### 1. Markdown  
The formatting is very easy to grasp and it utilizes basic common sense after getting done with the basics. Markdown is a great way to get into coding and stylize your work with various fonts, pictures, and other effects.

### 2. Javascript operations 
The operators are not completely new concepts when introduced, as they trail from basic math pre-requisites. This which helps me to understand the syntax better, especially since it makes me feel as if JavaScript is not something completely unfamiliar and rather something I can get a hang of eventually. 

### 3. Variable declaration
Javascript variables are also not difficult to comprehend, due to also stemming from past mathematical concepts. The keywords (i.e. var, let, const, etc.) are straightforward when included in projects, without any confusing loops or lines of code.

### 4. If-else loop
This type of loop is the easiest and simplest kind to understand. One of the past computer science lessons was practicing Scratch code, and this specific kind of loop was included in the available coding blocks. Being familiar with this concept helps me to apply this loop with the JS language, which just differs by syntax.

### 5. Switch case
Despite this being a new lesson, its logic is very simple and easy to navigate. It puts a twist on loops and allows us to change the outcome of our code and its output when printed. 

## List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.

### 1.  JS number objects
Its syntax can be quite difficult to comprehend, as there are many number methods you need to be comfortable with before using them normally for codes. There are also numerous values and properties to learn, which can often lead to overthinking while coding. 

### 2. Array
It might be similar to variable declaration, but the grouped data in brackets become a source of confusion for me when forming JavaScript codes. It gets even more complex when you convert an array to a string or objects, which often lengthens and intensifies the code, especially as a beginner to the coding language.

### 3. Functions
The keywords and concepts themselves are easy to breakdown, but bringing variables, specifically lengthy ones can complicate the code. Using other variables such as HEX codes for styles and links to embed can also make the code look scary and seem beyond my skillset.

### 4. Nested loop
Out of all the kinds of loops, nested loops are the most difficult for me to absorb. It is mainly due to its nature of having one loop inside another (inner/outer loops) which can often lead me to mix-ups when trying to use them for a code.

### 5. HTML event handlers
These give me a hard time, especially since this is mixing Javascript codes with HTML elements. Since they include user responses in order to trigger these events on a browser, this also makes things complicated for me when trying to input these responses.

## Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.

In this quarter, I was very overwhelmed with tasks of other subjects and unfortunately did not allocate enough time to study the syntax of certain JavaScript concepts. With this mistake now addressed, it's time to take action. From now on, I will make an active effort to be more productive with my tasks, as to improve time management and therefore have more available time to tackle these difficult topics.

## In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why? 

### 1. Effective activities
 * Interesting coding situations  
Most of the coding situations/projects discussed in class were often very interesting and held my attention. This helped me to grasp concepts easier with me enjoying the lesson. 
 * Less pressurized learning options  
The learning techniques used in Computer Science class were for the most part very innovative and way less pressuring for me. We were able to complete tasks productively, as the deadlines were more forgiving.

### 2. Not-as-effective activities
 * Most of the discussions on the board/projector  
I realized that a big part of the lessons were being held on the whiteboard or projector which I was having slight difficulties with. This is mainly since it's hard to give my equal attention to both the monitor as well as the board in front of me.
 * Lots of individual activities  
This is more of a personal learning preference, but I would rather have more in-person discussions rather than individual activities. This is because I prefer to have more guidance when tackling new concepts/lessons.
