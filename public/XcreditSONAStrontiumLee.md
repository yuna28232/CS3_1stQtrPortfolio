# **Take on SONA July 2025 of Pres. Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr.**
## by Yuna Lee of 9 - Strontium

### **1. Give 2-4 key points from the SONA 2025 that you found interesting.**

 * Education has now become a main priority, and was given the largest portion of the national budget: I found this point compelling and definitely something that us citizens and especially students to be optimistic about for our country.
 * The formation of new water filtration and supply systems: This action being taken to improve our water security is crucial, as over 5 percent of the Philippines's population has continued to suffer from inconsistent and/or contaminated water resources.

### **2. Give 1-3 key points from SONA 2025 that you found weird for any reason.**

 * The absent discussion of the West Philippine Sea territorial despute between the Philippines and China: It was quite odd to not have this issue included in this year's SONA, due to its weight on our political relations with China, as well as all of the possible dangers it might entail to our country if left unaddressed. 

### **3. Write 2 paragraphs of reflection.**

President Marcos Jr.'s fourth annual SONA has displayed productive efforts to improve some of the rapidly growing problems of our nation. From the expansion of healthcare services, all the way to stemming the blossoming corruption in flood control projects, this year's State of the Nation Address has proved to be successful and worthwhile for the further development of the Philippines. Provided that most, if not all of President Marcos's plans will push through, the quality of Filipino living, and even the country's reputation will be improved and refined. The Philippines will certainly undergo positive changes, and soon be a step closer to a "bagong Pilipinas".

Despite all of the positive points from Marcos's SONA 2025, there are still a few missing pieces that we need in order to understand the full picture. Some issues, such as the now-broken Bongbong Marcos/Sara Duterte tandem, and the ongoing battle for the West Phiippine Sea were not addressed by President Marcos. These problems, which many Filipinos anticipated to be discussed during the SONA, were surprisingly ignored, regardless of their political significance. 
With both positives and negatives in mind, the 2025 State of the Nation Address was effective and well-executed, yet might have left hindrances that could slow the growth and development of our country.


### **4. What is one word/phrase/sentence that you have for the Philippines after hearing SONA 2025?**

My *phrase* would be:
***Advancing gradually!***
